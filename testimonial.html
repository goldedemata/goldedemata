                This training gives me many challenges from my day one journey up to now because as I evaluated myself. I’m not expert when it comes about computer. During our time of my college days. We have computer subjects but our computer lab has only limited units of PC at the same time as a student we have only limited time to used the computer not like now a days that we have many trainings to offer about Information and Communications Technology.
The challenges during this training was not really easy for me because I’m starting comparing my self to the others or to my colleagues. I felt unease to my colleagues because they are more expert compared to myself. I just embrace and accept those challenges by working out, to continue what I have right now. I just enjoying with my colleagues at the same time learning because every meeting and topic that given to us by our every instructors were very important for me on this journey. To be honest as the days goes on I realized that this training really helps me in so many ways because I learned may things that I could share to my future learners. Those Microsoft Excel, Spreadsheet and PowerPoint lessons were very nice topics because I have now an ideas how to make it and I learned it from this training.
I told to my self every after the meeting, its another day done and I have new learnings again to be applied as a teacher to my future learners.
I’m so lucky and grateful to God above all as part of this training and for allowing me to be always present with my hectic schedules from the past few weeks and for the good health for each one of us especially to all our instructors in order for us to be always present. Thank you very much NBSC family for the opportunity to learned this training and  I’m very much thankful for all of you as our instructors for teaching us and sharing with us your knowledge. We are so lucky to have you ma’am and sir in this journey!
God Bless NBSC family and to our dear instructors!

Thank you!
